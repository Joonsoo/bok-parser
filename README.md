# Moon Parser

Moon Parser is a parser that supports languages with more flexible structure and richer idioms, along with laugnage analysis tools.

Moon Parser is featuring [dynamic parsing](https://github.com/Joonsoo/moon-parser/wiki/Dynamic-Parsing), which proceeds parsing and language analysis simultaneously. Moon Parser also includes visualization tools to show the given languages, parsed results, and parsing procedures. And I am planning to implement static language analyzer and parser generator.
